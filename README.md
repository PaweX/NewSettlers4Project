# NewSettlers4Project
A remake of The Settlers IV: *The New Settlers IV* - a copy of the original game with extra features. New features are meant to improve the game without changing the basis.

## What are the targets?
- create an open game which works and looks like The Settlers IV (well-optimised, imitator of S4)
- using original files (textures, sounds, maps)
- making interface very similar to the original one but better, HD

**Extra features:**
- supporting all standard resolutions
- support for Linux and maybe MacOS and Android (Windows is the default OS)
- smarter AI based on the original AI (but better and being able to remember things, learn, ally AI can trade with player etc.)
- extra buttons in the menu: 'options' to set more interface or game settings, like:
  - keyboard/mouse settings
  - graphics settings
  - sound settings
  - game settings (like: messages, mini map colours transparency etc.)
- improved economy system (mostly by 'fixing' issues known in the original game)
- 'fixing' known issues from the original game (especially network problems)
- extra game modes or game settings that can be selected before starting a game (button that allows to change the game mode, e.g. classic game mode)
- additional hidden command prompt for developers (it will show extra messages and allow to type in commands)
- playable Dark Tribe
- more advanced map editor that is compatible with the original one as much as possible




## Are you interested in the project?

I am more game designer than programmer. I can program, however when it comes to complex maths calculations like rendering the triangles in Settlers III or IV, I feel lost. If you want to help, then join the project and let's make an open, free version of Settlers IV with extras - under the MIT license.
